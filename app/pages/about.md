The European Union is one of the largest democracies in the world. The European Parliament, with its 705 members from the EU’s 27 member states, represents just over 440 million Europeans. Although European politics affects so many people, it often receives little public attention. Yet transparency of parliamentary processes is a fundamental prerequisite for forming opinions in democratic discourse.

Information such as agendas, minutes and the results of roll-call votes are generally available on the website of the European Parliament. However, it is rather difficult to find out what MEPs voted on or how a particular vote turned out. This is because the necessary information has to be gathered from various websites of the Parliament.

Our goal is to provide easy access to the voting results of the European Parliament. On this website, we clearly present votes and voting results as well as the voting behavior of individual MEPs. For this purpose, we automatically collect data from the various official parliamentary sources.

If you use the data from HowTheyVote.eu for your own projects, we would love to hear from you! And if you have an idea how HowTheyVote.eu could be even more helpful, feel free to open a ticket in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HowTheyVote/epvotes) or write us an [email](mailto:mail@howtheyvote.eu) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/HowTheyVoteEU).

The page is still in an early phase. **Please be aware that this means some votes might be missing in our data. In rare cases, we might also present an erroneous vote as the final one. This happens in cases in which the final vote was not a roll-call vote.** We will extend the available data in the future and continue working on additional functionality. If you find a mistake (e.g. wrong data for a vote) or something is not working as expected, we would appreciate if you contact us or open an issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HowTheyVote/epvotes).
