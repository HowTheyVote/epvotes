    'parliament' => 'The European Union is one of the largest democracies in the world. The European Parliament, with its 705 members from the EU\'s 27 member states, represents just over 440 million Europeans. Although European politics affects so many people, it often receives little public attention. Yet transparency of parliamentary processes is a fundamental prerequisite for forming opinions in democratic discourse.',

However, it is rather difficult to find out what MEPs voted on or how a particular vote turned out. This is because the necessary information has to be gathered from various websites of the Parliament.',
