# HowTheyVote.eu

[HowTheyVote.eu](https://howtheyvote.eu) allows anyone to easily find out how Members of the European Parliament vote in plenary.

Although the results of roll-call votes are generally available on the website of the European Parliament, it is rather difficult to find out what MEPs voted on or how a particular vote turned out. This is because the necessary information has to be gathered from various websites of the Parliament. HowTheyVote.eu automatically scrapes information from multiple official sources and presents them in a simple UI.

## Development Setup

We use Docker for our development setup. This setup is intended for development purposes only!

1. Make sure ports 3306, 5000 and 8000 are free.
2. Install `docker` and `docker-compose`. You can find instruction on how to install Docker on the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
3. Run `docker-compose run app composer install` to install PHP dependencies.
4. Run `docker-compose run app npm install` to install Node.js dependencies.
5. Run `docker-compose run app npm run dev` to build the frontend assets. Alternatively, you can run `docker-compose run app npm run watch`, to rebuild the assets automatically on file changes.
5. Run `docker-compose up`.
6. Create `.env` files based on `scrapers/.env.example` and `app/.env.example`. Afterwards, run `php artisan key:generate` inside the `app` container.
7. When creating a fresh development environment with a clean DB, execute `php artisan migrate`, `php artisan db:seed --class=GroupSeeder`, and `php artisan db:seed --class=TermSeeder` inside the `app` container (e.g. with `docker-compose exec`). Alternatively, you can also import e.g. the [HowTheyVote.eu](https://howtheyvote.eu) database dump that can be found [here](https://github.com/HowTheyVote/data). Run `mariadb/import_database.sh` to import a database and change the `.sql` file's path inside of the script if necessary.
8. Run `php artisan scout:import '\App\VotingList'` to initialize the search index.

### Database Dumps

We provide a (small) dump in the `mariadb/dump` directory that can be imported using `mariadb/dump/import_database.sh`.
The latest production database can be retrieved from our [data repository](https://github.com/HowTheyVote/data). 
If you have scraped data the `mariadb/dump/export_database.sh` script can be used to create a new dump.

To familiarize yourself with the schema of the database, the models in `app/app/*.php` are a good starting point.

### FAQ/Help

- To run the tests for the Laravel application, run `composer test`. Do **not** run `php artisan test`, as that will clear your local database.
- After running the tests you will need to execute `php artisan config:cache` to be able to access the database from your local application instance again. When troubleshooting local problems with accessing the database, this is in general a good first step.
- To run the tests for the python scrapers, execute `make test`.
- Before submitting a PR, remember to run `make` inside of `/scrapers` and `composer cs-fix`, as well as `composer test` in `/app`. Non-linted code as well as failing tests will be rejected by our CI.

## Production Deployment

We’re using [Ansible](https://ansible.org) to manage server provisioning and deployment to production environments. Currently, the Ansible playbook `ansible/site.yml` supports deploying EP-Votes to a fresh [Uberspace 7](https://uberspace.de) account.

1. Install Ansible 2.10 or later. Update `ansible/hosts` and the respective host variables.
2. Run `ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts --ask-vault-pass ansible/site.yml` to set up the Uberspace and deploy the application.
3. Run `ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts --ask-vault-pass ansible/meilisearch.yml` to compile and configure the MeiliSearch search server. This may take some time and it’s *not* necessary to run this playbook on every deployment.
